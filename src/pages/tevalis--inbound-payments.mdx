# Sending payments to us

## How to

POST JSON to `https://sticky.to/v2/connectionhook/---/CONNECTION_TEVALIS/private--payment` with an `Authorization` header as `Bearer [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]`. Don't prepend the key with `private:`.

```
{
	"sessionId": "1667e296-cb62-4f6e-8aa7-e898d62c3d11",
	"total": 100
}
```

`sessionId`: UUID.

`total`: Integer ($1.00 USD = `100`).

`discount`: Integer (not a %; $0.20 = `20`); optional.

`paymentGatewayId`: String (external reference); optional.

`cart`: Array of objects validated strictly; optional:

```
[
  {
    "productId": "UUID (must be a UUID that exists); optional",
    "productName": "String; required",
    "productPrice": "Integer; required",
    "productTheirId": "String (ID of a product on your remote system e.g. a PLU); optional",
    "quantity": "Integer; required"
  }
]
```

```

## Questions and answers

### Is the discount a total of discount on the bill (regardless of entry point, i.e. in dashboard or manually applied on the POS), or should it just be the in dashboard discount?

`discount` should be a total of discount on the bill, regardless of entry point.

### Should the `total` be before or after a discount (scenario: bill was 120 discounted by 20 to 100)?

`discount` should be `20` and `total` should be 100. `total` is the actual amount the consumer pays.

### Is each `cart` item before or after a discount?

We don't have support for discounts per `cart` item. The best approach is setting `productPrice` as a value before any discounts, e.g. 120 in the previous question.

### Is `cart` item `productPrice` the price of the line, or the price of the product (scenario: there are 2 of the same product each costing 50)?

It's the price of the product. Send `productPrice` as 50 with a quantity of 2.
