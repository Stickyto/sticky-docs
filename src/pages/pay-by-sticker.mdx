# Pay by sticker

## Important

This will be available from Friday 13 October 2023.

## Getting UUIDs

Use the dashboard URL when you are looking at the right sticker or flow.

For stickers (`thingId`):

`http://localhost:3003/me/stickies/[UUID_IS_HERE]`

For flows (`applicationId`):

`http://localhost:3003/me/flows/[UUID_IS_HERE]`

## How to

POST JSON to `https://sticky.to/v2/trigger/payByThing` with an `Authorization` header as `Bearer [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]`.

The sticker will automatically change back to its previous flow when the payment is successful.

```
{
  "total": 120,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "thingId": "9ec78ca7-1c60-40f3-807d-d08c7a170e76",
  "applicationId": "83f35dc3-f412-4f0e-81f8-67cf76324a2c"
}
```

`total`: Integer ($1.00 USD = `100`).

`currency`: String (`USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`...).

`thingId`: UUID; ID of the sticker.

`applicationId`: UUID; ID of the flow.

`userPaymentId`: String (external reference); optional.
