# Setting Up Customer Domain Authentication in SendGrid

## Steps

### Access SendGrid

1. Log into SendGrid using your administrative credentials.
2. Navigate to 'Settings' and then select 'Sender Authentication'.

### Domain Authentication

1. Click on 'Get Started' under the 'Domain Authentication' section.
2. Enter the customer’s domain name and select whether they will be using the domain to send emails via SendGrid.

### Generate DNS Records

1. SendGrid will generate the necessary DKIM and TXT records for the domain authentication.
2. Copy these records to be sent to the customer or directly to their DNS provider.

### Verification Process

1. Instruct the customer to add these records to their domain’s DNS settings through their domain registrar's control panel.
2. Confirm with the customer once they have updated their DNS records.

### Verify Records in SendGrid

1. Once the customer has confirmed adding the records, click the 'Verify' button in SendGrid to check the records.
2. If there are issues, troubleshoot common problems (like propagation delays or incorrect record values) and advise accordingly.

### Documentation and Record Keeping

1. Document the customer’s domain, the records provided, and the date of setup in your internal CRM or documentation tool.
2. Note any follow-up actions or unresolved issues.
