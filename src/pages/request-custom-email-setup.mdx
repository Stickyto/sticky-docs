# Requesting custom email setup

**To request a custom email setup using your domain, please email [dev@sticky.to](mailto:dev@sticky.to) with your Dashboard ID.**

Our team will then create the required DNS records for your domain. These include:

1. **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Helps to ensure that your emails are not marked as spam.
2. **TXT Records**: Used for verifying domain ownership and essential email security settings.

## Instructions

1. Log in to your domain hosting provider's control panel.
2. Navigate to the DNS management page.
3. Add the provided DKIM and TXT records to your DNS settings.
4. Save changes and wait for the DNS to propagate, which may take up to 48 hours.
