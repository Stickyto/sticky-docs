# Embedded POS

Sticky's POS ("Point of sale") can be embedded in an iframe.

You will need to expose your private key, so only embed POS in safe, non-consumer environments where the URL is not visible.

## URL

Copy the URL from the "Point of sale" in the dashboard.

Example:

```
https://dashboard.sticky.to/ops-manager?userPrivateKey=[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]&userPublicKey=[YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY]
```

### `autoAddPayment` URL parameter

You can automatically add a payment by setting `autoAddPayment=true`.

Doing this means a POS user only needs to "Add to total" and "Pay by Sticky" or "Pay by link".

`true` is the only value that works; any other value will be ignored.

Example:

```
https://dashboard.sticky.to/ops-manager?userPrivateKey=[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]&userPublicKey=[YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY]&autoAddPayment=true
```
