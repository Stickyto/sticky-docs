## Sticky's platform has specific controls for "kid safety"

Each sticky (sticker or QR code) has a "Kid safe" toggle:

**When the toggle is turned OFF**, Sticky sets a `sticky-sessionid` cookie containing a session ID, a persistent identifier. This session ID refers to a server-side record which contains PII and references event records that contain PII like IP addresses, locations and user agent strings. This is not "kid safe".

By tapping a sticky or scanning a QR code, you can see the server sets its cookie:

**When the toggle is turned ON**, Sticky does not create a server-side record or set a cookie. Instead, Sticky uses a single predefined "kid safe" session shared between all kids. This can be seen through HTTP; no cookie is set anymore:

No matter the device, activity is logged against the single "kid safe" session, always with the same ID:

This session is hard-defined in Sticky's code:

Every event record is geo-located for reporting and analytics but the IP address is not stored. Sticky proves this at the database level:

The geolocation is never more precise than the current city, is not (and cannot be) connected to an individual as there is no cookie or persistent identifier.
