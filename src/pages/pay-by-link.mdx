# Pay by link

## One time set up: Add a "Take a payment flow"

Choose **Add a flow**:

![](/pbl-flow-1.png)

Choose **Take a payment**:

![](/pbl-flow-2.png)

Go inside the flow by choosing it from the list.

## Get its UUID

Use the dashboard URL when you are looking at the flow.

`https://dashboard.sticky.to/me/flows/[UUID_OF_FLOW]`

Keep the `[UUID_OF_FLOW]` to hand.

## Step 1: Add a payment

POST JSON to `https://sticky.to/v1/applications/unknown-application-3/payments` with an `Authorization` header as `Bearer [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]`. Even though this URL looks strange it is 100% correct; you don't need `[UUID_OF_FLOW]` until later.

```
{
  "total": 123,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "userPaymentId": "My external reference",
  "email": "tim@sticky.to",
  "phone": "+44123123123"
}
```

`total`: Integer ($1.00 USD = `100`).

`currency`: String (`USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`...).

`userPaymentId`: String (external reference); optional.

`email`: Email; optional.

`phone`: Phone; optional. Include country code for safety.

This will return:

```
{
  "id": "[UUID_OF_CREATED_PAYMENT]"
}
```

Keep the `[UUID_OF_CREATED_PAYMENT]` to hand.

## Step 2: Create a link

POST JSON to `https://sticky.to/v2/short-links` with an `Authorization` header as `Bearer [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]`.

The JSON's ` whichUrl` key must have the format:

`https://sticky.to/go/flow/[UUID_OF_FLOW]?paymentId=[UUID_OF_CREATED_PAYMENT]`

```
{
  "whichUrl": "https://sticky.to/go/flow/[UUID_OF_FLOW]?paymentId=[UUID_OF_CREATED_PAYMENT]",
  "type": "REDIRECT"
}
```

This will return:

```
{
  "id": "[UUID_OF_LINK]"
}
```

Keep the `[UUID_OF_LINK]` to hand.

## Step 3: Send the link

POST JSON to `https://sticky.to/v2/trigger/share` with an `Authorization` header as `Bearer [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]`.

You can POST to these URLs multiple times.
