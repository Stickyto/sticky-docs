## API endpoints

 - `https://sticky.to`
 - `https://instantdebit.co.uk`

## Authentication

Go to **dashboard.sticky.to/developer/keys** to find your public key (read only / used by consumers) and private key (danger - do not embed in public facing scenarios!).

Use these keys to authenticate against our API, which is fully RESTful API and sends/receives JSON exactly as you'd expect.

There is no sandbox environment under a different URL. Send us a message if you want another dashboard with different keys.

Authentication is via `Bearer` tokens.

### Routes with dynamic authentication

Some routes accept both public and private keys. One example is `GET /v1/products`. A public key returns basic data like name and images - enough to let a consumer choose a product. A private key returns all of the data you can see in the dashboard.

Prepend the key with `public:` or `private:` for these routes.

### Routes without dynamic authentication

Other routes accept just public or private keys. One example is `POST /v1/products` which can only be called with a private key.

Don't prepend the key with `private:`.

In the examples below, add the correct domain before `/v1` or `/v2`, for example `https://sticky.to/v2` or `https://instantdebit.co.uk/v2`.

### Example: public key

```
curl --request GET \
  --url /v1/users/me \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer public:public-b3c64fdc-b37f-44fc-83e4-53206e7adb8c'
```

Notice that the response is limited:

```
{
  "name": "My dashboard",
  "currency": "GBP"
}
```

### Example: private key

```
curl --request GET \
  --url /v1/users/me \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer private:private-371eff35-9bff-461e-b97b-d9405176e257'
```

Notice that the response is expansive:

```
{
  "name": "My dashboard",
  "currency": "GBP",
  "email": "me@my-dashboard.com"
}
```

## Terminology
